            <h1>Dear Admissions Committee,</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Anton Svirkul and I am applying to New York University in Prague to study for a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at one of the most prestigious universities in the Czech Republic. I am highly interested in the variety of academic programmes and the curriculum specifically for my major. I should also mention that the university offers special corporate programmes that help you gain experience during your internship and become a highly qualified specialist.</p>
            <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
            <p>I have already mentioned on the website that I spent most of my adult life in the national park, studying online with Ukrainian teachers from the "Angstrem" school, which made me even more convinced throughout that time that information technology and new discoveries can really make life easier for many people. At school, I participated in many events organised by the school itself. One of them was the Global STEM Education Centre programme, where I and other students from my school and the Dutch school developed a project about the big bang, presenting it to real Nasa members at the end. <a target="_blank" href="https://angstremua.com/veliki-kanikuli/">(https://angstremua.com/veliki-kanikuli/).</a>
            <p>At the age of 13, I first tried to create my own web page, but realising that my knowledge would not be enough to create my first "projects", my parents found me private courses where I first got acquainted with the markup language and gained basic knowledge of web page coding. </p>
            <p>Since then, I've noticed that I'm very attracted to solving various problems and enjoy solving both the problems from my course instructor and the various mathematical equations I learned at school. And the choice of my speciality, which I plan to study, was influenced by my surroundings and ideas, from which I still get a lot of inspiration.</p>
            <h2>Why have I chosen UNYP?</h2>
            <p>After reading the information on the website and reading about New York, one of the main advantages for me is the career prospects that UNYP and the international community provide, which allows me to exchange experiences and ideas with people from all over the world. 
            </p>

            <p>Also, the influence of experienced university professors and their international experience, which will greatly enhance the knowledge, is not to be overlooked. Plus, the small number of students in a group makes it possible to pay more attention to each student. </p>
                
            <p>Besides, I am personally attracted by the vibrant student life, namely extracurricular activities and various clubs that will allow you to find like-minded people and spend more time together and implement new ideas.</p>
            <h3>Why should I be chosen?</h3>
            <p>Having gained, to be honest, a unique and extraordinary experience in Kenya, which allowed me to look at the world from a truly different angle and find many different ideas and personal goals that I want to implement in my future, I can safely say that I am ready for a new stage in my life and for new challenges that will only strengthen my personal skills and allow me not only to become a qualified specialist, but also to bring even more original and useful projects.  </p>
            <span>Thank you very much for your attention and time.</span>
            <p class="bold">Sincerely, </p>
            <span class="bold">Svirkul Anton</span>
